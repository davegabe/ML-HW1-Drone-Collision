\section{Conclusions}
The results obtained for both the classification and the regression task are not satisfactory and the models are not able to predict the collision risk with a good accuracy.

For the classification task, all the models have reached a F1 score lower than 0.5. The best F1 score is obtained by the he Support Vector Machine classifier has the best F1 score (0.4579).

For the regression task, the Gradient Boosting Regression has the best R2 score (-0.00721) and the Support Vector Regression has the best MSE (0.03922).

Since the bad performances achieved by all the algorithms, it is not possible to conclude which one is the best for this dataset.
The reasons for the poor performance of the models are the complexity of the problem, which has a lot of features, and the unbalanced dataset, which has a lot of samples of the majority class and few samples of the minority class.
